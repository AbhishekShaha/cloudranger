#### Module 2 Lesson 2 (Part 1): Implementing and managing virtual networks

In this lesson I get into details of Azure Virtual Networks and how to implement them. This is a jam-packed lesson with loads of hands-on stuff. I explain the characteristics of virtual networks and subnets. After explaining some concepts, we go hands-on in building an actual Azure virtual network with two subnets through the Azure portal. As a bonus I also show how to create virtual machines through the Azure portal. After creating the virtual machines in the virtual networks, I show how the Azure built-in DHCP and DNS works.
