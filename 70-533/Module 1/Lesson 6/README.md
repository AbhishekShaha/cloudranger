#### Module 1 Lesson 6: Overview of Azure deployment models

In this lesson I explain the theoritical concepts of Azure Resource Manager (ARM); the latest deployment model in Azure. I go over what ARM is and the frequent terms used in ARM. I also go over the Azure portal to show what a resource is and how resource providers provide the resources that are all placed in a Resource Group. I further get into some introduction of what Azure templates are and how to quickly look at a Resource template right from the Azure portal.
