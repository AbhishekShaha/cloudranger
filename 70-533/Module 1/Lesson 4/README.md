#### Module 1 Lesson 4: Managing Azure with Windows PowerShell

This lesson is all about how to use Windows PowerShell to get connected to Azure subscription. I go over the need for Azure PowerShell and all the possible ways to get it installed through Web Platform Installer, PowerShell gallery, Microsoft MSI and Azure Cloud Shell for PowerShell. As a bonus I also show how Azure PowerShell can be installed and used on Linux platforms (I demonstrate this through Windows 10 Bash shell).
