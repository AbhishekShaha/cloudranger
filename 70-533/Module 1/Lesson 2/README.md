#### Module 1 Lesson 2: Overview of Azure

In this lesson I provide a high level introduction to Microsoft Azure. I get into the details of Azure regions, datacenters, paired regions and how accounts and subscriptions play an integral part of Azure. I further divulge into the Azure billing and get into the various "pay" models that works for both personal and organizational use. Moving on, I discuss various Azure services and where to get the list of all Azure services. I end this lesson with all the management tools that Azure provides to interact with various Azure services.
